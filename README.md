IEEE 1588 PTP daemon for STM32H7 and ATSAME70 microcontrollers. The software is tested to work with LWIP 2.x. You need to have IGMP enabled and working in LWIP. To use the daemon, just copy-paste the ptp folder to your solution. From port folder copy the required ptpd_dep.c and ptpd_dep.h files to the ptp/dep folder.
